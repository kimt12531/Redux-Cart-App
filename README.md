# Redux Cart App
Redux Cart App is a simple shopping cart app developed in React with Javascript. It is connected to a backend database hosted by firebase realtime database, where products are fetched and cart items are updated. This project uses the react-redux library and the redux toolkit to manage state with reducers.

In addition for visibility, a notification will appear in the UI to indicate reponse status during and after network requests. The shopping cart may also be toggled via clicking *My Cart*. 

This portfolio project was completed as part of Advanced Redux coursework for [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) on Udemy instructed by Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller.

Further enhancements were added outside of course requirements including:
- redux to manage the shop products, replacing the dummy products object provided in the starter code
- implemented a checkout button at the bottom of 'Your Shopping Cart'
- changes to CSS modules
